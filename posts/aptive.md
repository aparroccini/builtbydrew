Aptive was our first project using both Unslated and a headless CMS (contentful). Built with an atomic mindset. We created nearly 30 unique components to use within the website, most with a degree of animation added to them. 

Working closy with the visual design team, we were able to create beautiful components that were easily customizable and were easily integrated in the content model. 

With this streamlined approach, we were able to hit our release date with time to spare.
