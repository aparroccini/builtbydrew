Pacificorp came to us needing an updated website for their millions of users nationwide. We worked closley with their talented development team to create a two prong approach. On one side, we built an AEM site, with Unslated driving the UI library. 

On the other side, we used Angular 8 to create the secure self service site allowing customers to report outages, pay bills and change service on the fly.
