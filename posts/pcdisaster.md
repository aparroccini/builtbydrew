Pacificorp needed to create an internal site to use in case of a disaster (such as covid) that could be stood up quickly and perform under stressful network conditions. 

We used a headless CMS approach along with Angular, allowing us to minimize the amount of calls to the server that we need, and creating the ability to 'check in' to report that you are safe. We also created an admin UI to review and export the data collected.
