Black Eyed Susan Spice Company approached me looking for a simple site that fit their needs and their budget. I purchased an existing theme and built off that to include a robust e-commerce solution.

Features also include: 

- Marketing pages
- Comments and rating system
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation
- Square Integration
- Slider Revolution
