Ready Patient exists to cultivate hope and build connections. From their website, "Knowledge is power. Our content is designed to empower you by connecting you with people, resources, and tools to help you along your personal journey to alleviate joint pain." 

We built this site in AEM with our internal Unslated UI library for a base. We also worked closley with their internal developers to have a clean knowledge transfer.
